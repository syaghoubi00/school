# [Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/d-khan/dslabs/blob/main/intro/binary-search-trees-activity.md)

## Task 1

> Imagine you were to take an empty binary search tree and insert the following
> sequence of numbers in this order: `[1, 5, 9, 2, 4, 10, 6, 3, 8]`. Draw a
> diagram showing what the binary search tree would look like. Remember, the
> numbers are being inserted in the order presented here.

## Task 2

> If a well-balanced binary search tree contains 1,000 values, what is the
> maximum number of steps it would take to search for a value within it?

## Task 3

> Write an algorithm that finds the greatest value within a binary search tree.

## Task 4

> Write a code in C++ using the same array mentioned in [Task 1](#task-1) and
> implement a binary search tree. Only insertion operation is required.
