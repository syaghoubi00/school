## Task 1

> Assume you have a simple single-dimensional array
>
> `array = [200, 400, 100, 50, 350]`
>
> Linear search will take $O(n)$. Write a code in C++/Python to improve the
> search operation efficiency from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$.

_see_: [Task-1 (python)](task-1.py)

## Task 2

> Use C++, generate hash value of your name.

_see_: (./task-2.cpp)

## Task 3

> With the help of a figure, explain the problem that occured due to introducing
> a tombstone to mark the deleted cell.
